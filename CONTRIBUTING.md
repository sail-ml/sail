## Contributing to SAIL

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SAIL! Please follow the policies before implementing anything new.

Immediate fixes are allowed to go to master, however PLEASE contact [Tucker Siegel](https://github.com/tgs266) before doing so. If you are working on a larger, long term build, branch of master and begin building. Eventually, once the first version is released, SAIL will move to branching by version, and then features will branch off of those versions.

1. You have an awesome idea and want to build it
	- Post your idea in an [issue](https://github.com/sail-ml/sail/issues), and we will discuss how to design and build it. Once we all agree on the idea and design, the we can start building it.
2. You want to build an existing proposed feature or bug-fix
